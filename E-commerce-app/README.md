# E-commerce App

A modern, fully responsive e-commerce web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project simulates a real online shopping experience, including product browsing, advanced filtering, cart, wishlist, user authentication, reviews, and an admin panel for product management.
