## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Image Errors:**  
  Ensure local image file names match exactly (e.g., `beef.png` not `Beef.png`).
  
- **API Issues:**  
  All API calls use `https://`. If something doesn’t load, check the browser console (CORS, 404, etc.).

- **Local vs Vercel:**  
  Confirm that file paths and image casing are correct, especially for deployment.
